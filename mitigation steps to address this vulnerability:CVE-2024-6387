1-Upgrading OpenSSH
	If an upgrade path is available that patches CVE-2024-6387, it is recommended to update OpenSSH to this version. 
	Follow these general steps to upgrade OpenSSH
	
	A-Check Current Version Verify the current version of OpenSSH installed 
	on your system:   ssh -V
	
	B-Search for Available Versions Check if a patched version is available 
	in your distribution's repository: apt list -a openssh-server
	
	C-Upgrade OpenSSH If a secure version is available, 
	upgrade using the package manager:
	sudo apt update
	sudo apt upgrade openssh-server
	
	D-Restart the SSH Service Restart the SSH daemon 
	to apply the upgrade: systemctl restart sshd.service
	
	E-Verify the Upgrade Check the version again to ensure the 
	upgrade was successful: ssh -V
	
	
	2-Configuring LoginGraceTime
    The LoginGraceTime parameter specifies the time limit for SSH clients to authenticate successfully.
    Setting this parameter to 0 can effectively reduce the vulnerability window by requiring immediate authentication upon connection.
	
	A-Steps to Adjust LoginGraceTime
	Open the SSH Configuration File As the root user, open the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file using a text editor.
 	For example: vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
	
	B- Modify the LoginGraceTime Parameter Locate the LoginGraceTime parameter.
	If it exists, modify it to: LoginGraceTime 0
	If the parameter does not exist, add it to the file with the same setting.
	Save and Close the File After making the changes, save the file and exit the text editor.

    C-Restart the SSH Service Apply the changes
	by restarting the SSH daemon:  systemctl restart sshd.service
	
	D-Verify the Configuration (Optional) Ensure that the configuration has been applied
	correctly: sshd -T | grep logingracetime
	This command should output logingracetime 0, confirming that the setting is applied.
